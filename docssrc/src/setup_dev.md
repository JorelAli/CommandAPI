# Setting up your development environment

To use the CommandAPI in your plugins, there are a few methods of adding it to your development environment. First things first, if you're using the CommandAPI plugin, you need to add the CommandAPI as a dependent in your `plugin.yml` or `paper-plugin.yml`:

<div class="multi-pre">

```yaml, plugin.yml_(Bukkit/Spigot/Paper)
name: MyPlugin
main: some.package.name.Main
version: 1.0
depend: [CommandAPI]
```

```yaml, paper-plugin.yml_(Paper)
name: MyPlugin
main: some.package.name.Main
version: 1.0
dependencies:
  server:
    CommandAPI:
      load: BEFORE
      required: true
      join-classpath: true
```

</div>

## Using Maven (recommended)

> **Developer's Note:**
>
> If you've never used maven before, I highly recommend it! It makes it easier to keep your code updated with the latest dependency updates. For information on how to set up a plugin using maven, you can read [Bukkit's plugin tutorial](https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Plugin_Tutorial).

- Add the dependency to your `pom.xml`:

<div class="multi-pre">

  ```xml,Paper
  <dependencies>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>dev.jorel</groupId>
          <artifactId>commandapi-paper-core</artifactId>
          <version>9.6.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
          <scope>provided</scope>
      </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ```

  ```xml,Spigot
  <dependencies>
      <dependency>
          <groupId>dev.jorel</groupId>
          <artifactId>commandapi-spigot-core</artifactId>
          <version>9.6.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
          <scope>provided</scope>
      </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ```

</div>

## Using Gradle (recommended)

- Add the repositories to your `build.gradle` file (the second repository is required because the CommandAPI depends on the NBT-API):

  ```gradle
  repositories {
      mavenCentral()
      maven { url = "https://repo.codemc.org/repository/maven-public/" }
  }
  ```
  
- Add the dependency to your list of dependencies in your `build.gradle` file:

<div class="multi-pre">

  ```gradle,Paper
  dependencies {
      compileOnly "dev.jorel:commandapi-paper-core:9.6.2-SNAPSHOT"
  }
  ```

  ```gradle,Spigot
  dependencies {
      compileOnly "dev.jorel:commandapi-spigot-core:9.6.2-SNAPSHOT"
  }
  ```

</div>

## Manually using the .jar

- Download the latest CommandAPI.jar from the download page [here](https://github.com/JorelAli/CommandAPI/releases/latest)

- Add the CommandAPI.jar file to your project/environment's build path:

  - Adding the external .jar file in Eclipse:

    ![An image of some context menu entries in Eclipse after right clicking a project. Displays the highlighted options "Build Path", followed by "Add External Archives..."](images/eclipse.jpg)

  - Adding the external .jar file in IntelliJ:

    - In your project, first click `File` -> `Project Structure` -> `Libraries`

    - Next, click the little `+` at the top:

      ![An image in IntelliJ showing the plus icon to add an external .jar.](images/intellij.png)

    - After you clicked that, you need to select `Java`. A little pop-up will appear where you can choose the location of your external .jar file.
